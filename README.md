Christmas list, for groups of people to claim, but not see who's taken it off your list.
This was initially built over the past few months just for fun, as I have a group of about 5 people who all have christmas lists.
Although there are similar apps on the market, it's a challenge to create my own.

--How it works--

As an example:
People 1-5 each have Christmas lists (or any other celebration! This is just my example!)
Person 3 buys something off person 1's list and crosses it off
Person 2,3,4,5 can see that item is crossed off person 1's list.
Person 1 can't see anything crossed off.

-- Problems it solves -- 

With a regular shared doc as a list, if person 1 wanted to go add something else to their list, they will see along with
all the others in that group what they are getting, and that spoils the fun! 

-- Languages I have used so far --

HTML
CSS
PHP
JS
